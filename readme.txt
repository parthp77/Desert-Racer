DESERT RACER by Parth Patel

The basic idea of the game is to prevent the F1 (user) car from colliding with other cars on the road. The best way to do
so is to be in the other lane. If they collide, you lose a life.

REQUIREMENTS:
The game should be playable on a small screen.  Stick to 800x600 resolution. 
	yup
Playing the game should require some skill (math, memory, typing speed, fast reflexes, or something)
	fast reflexes, especially once the game speeds up
The game should end when a maximum number of lives (tries) has been used up. The number of lives should be displayed on screen.
	yup, 4 lives in the Top left corner
The game should have a score that is displayed on screen.
	yup, top right corner
The difficulty should increase as the game, or life, goes on
	speeds up every 20 seconds
The game should do input validation and error recovery.  The game should not crash because the user made an incorrect input (though the user may lose a life)
	the car ONLY moves with certain keys, so yeah.
The game should have sound effects (soundbible has a fair number of these).
	Yup, effects when hitting the car and when you die
The game should have a soundtrack that plays while the game is playing.
	Yup (although it sounds bad)
The game should include a start screen, a game over screen, and reasonable pauses between rounds or lives.
	Yes, I have a start screen and game over screen. BUT I could not get pauses.
